🚴‍♂️ **Just Finished My Google Data Analytics Capstone Project!**  
🔍 *How do casual and member riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

As part of the #GoogleDataAnalytics Certificate, I analyzed over 5 million bike trips from Chicago’s bike-share program using **R and Tableau**. My goal was to help Cyclistic’s marketing team better understand rider behavior and convert casual riders into members.

Here’s what I discovered:
✅ Casual riders take longer trips on average, mostly on weekends and afternoons  
✅ Members ride more consistently on weekdays and during commuting hours  
✅ Classic bikes are the most preferred ride for both groups

💡 My favorite part? Building insights that tie directly into business strategy!

📊 Tools Used:
- R (Tidyverse, Lubridate)
- Tableau
- Data storytelling & cleaning techniques

📁 I’ve shared the project on GitHub and Tableau Public:

I'm excited to apply these skills in a real-world role!
