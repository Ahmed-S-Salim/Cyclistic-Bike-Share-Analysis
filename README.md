## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of the final capstone for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal is to help **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, analyze how **casual riders** and **annual members** use their bikes differently‚Äîultimately helping the marketing team develop a strategy to convert more casual users into members.

---

## üéØ Business Task
**Main question:**  
How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?

By identifying usage patterns over a 12-month period, Cyclistic can build targeted marketing strategies to boost membership subscriptions.

## üßº Data Cleaning Summary (R)
- Combined 12 monthly `.csv` files using `rbind()`  
- Removed:
  - Rows with missing or null values  
  - Duplicate records  
  - Rides with zero or negative duration  
- Engineered columns:
  - `ride_length` in minutes  
  - `day_of_week`, `hour`, `season`, and `time_of_day`

## üìä Dashboard Note
After completing the analysis and designing the dashboard in **Power BI**, I discovered that Power BI Public does not support sharing `.pbix` files or dashboards from the free version.  
‚û°Ô∏è To ensure insights remain accessible, I exported the dashboard as a **PDF report**, which includes all visuals, charts, and KPIs.
