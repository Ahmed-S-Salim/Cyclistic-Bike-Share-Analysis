## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of the final capstone for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal is to help **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, analyze how **casual riders** and **annual members** use their bikes differently‚Äîultimately helping the marketing team develop a strategy to convert more casual users into members.

---

## üéØ Business Task
**Main question:**  
How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?

By identifying usage patterns over a 12-month period, Cyclistic can build targeted marketing strategies to boost membership subscriptions.

## üßº Data Cleaning Process (R)
- Merged all 12 monthly `.csv` files
- Filtered out nulls, duplicates, and negative ride durations
- Engineered new features: `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, `season`, `hour`, `time_of_day`
- Removed unused fields like GPS and station IDs
- Exported the cleaned dataset to `.csv` for Power BI visualization

## üìä Dashboard & Visualizations
Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI featuring:
- Total rides and ride duration KPIs
- Monthly ride trends
- Time-of-day & day-of-week usage patterns
- Seasonality and rider type comparisons
- Member vs. Casual behavior breakdown
