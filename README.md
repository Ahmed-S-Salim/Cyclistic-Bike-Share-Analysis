## üìå Project Overview

This project is the final capstone for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal is to help **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use their service differently. By identifying usage patterns, the company can develop strategies to convert more casual riders into loyal, long-term members.

## üéØ Business Task

**Objective:**  
Analyze 12 months of historical ride data to answer:  
**"How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?"**

The final insights will support the Cyclistic marketing team‚Äôs goal of increasing membership.

## üìÇ Data Source

The data was provided by Motivate International Inc. and made public through the [Divvy bike-share system](https://divvybikes.com/system-data).  
- **Date range:** August 2020 to July 2021  
- **Files:** 12 monthly `.csv` files  
- **Size:** Over 5 million rows of ride-level data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills Used

- **R**: Data cleaning, transformation, summarization
- **Tidyverse**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `tidyr` for data wrangling
- **Lubridate**: Date & time manipulation
- **HMS**: Time-of-day classification
- **Data.table**: Export cleaned dataset
- **RStudio**: Environment for running and testing all code

---

## üßº Data Cleaning Steps

- Combined 12 months of ride data using `rbind()`
- Removed missing and duplicate rows
- Created a `ride_length` column (in minutes)
- Filtered out rides with zero or negative duration
- Dropped unnecessary columns (IDs and GPS coordinates)
- Extracted features: date, time, day of week, season, hour, and time of day

---

## üìà Key Insights

- **Members ride more frequently than casual users.**
- **Casual riders take longer rides on average.**
- **Casual users ride more on weekends and afternoons.**
- **Members are more active during weekday mornings and commute hours.**
- **Classic bikes are the most commonly used type across both groups.**

---

## üìä Next Steps

- Build visualizations using Tableau or Power BI (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts).
- Present key findings to stakeholders with actionable business recommendations:
  - Launch weekend promotions for casual users.
  - Target email campaigns based on time-of-day ride habits.
  - Offer free trial weeks during high-use seasons.
